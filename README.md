# Complex number support for Pytorch

This python library implements differentiable complex operations for use in Pytorch (multiply, divide, exponentiate, power, etc). Complex tensors are structured as Pytorch tensors followed by an extra dimension of size two and store the real and imaginary components.  

## Install

python setup.py

## Comment

Since the recent rollout of complex type support in Pytorch, support of this library has been retired.
